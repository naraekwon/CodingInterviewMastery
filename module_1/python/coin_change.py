Title: Coin Change
Leetcode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/

Problem: You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount
of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins
that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be
made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

Input:
    coins: List[int]    => denominations of coins available
    amount: int         => amount of change to make
Output:
    int                 => minimum number of coins needed

Execution: python coin_change.py

Solution #1: Brute Force

Recursively find every combination of coins and find the combination that
uses the fewest number of coins.
